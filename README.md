A discrete FFT-based technique to compute electromagnetic field in the vicinity of the focal plane of a high NA objective lens. Technique is explained in [[1]](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.565420). It basically performs the discrete numerical implementation of the Debye-Wolf integral. Implementation is done in python using jupyter notebooks. The notebook was used to create plots in [2]. 

## Usage notes

The notebooks are located in the *content* folder. You can download them an install ad use [jupyter lab](https://jupyter.org/install) to run them.

You can also use the browser-based [jupyter lite](https://jupyterlite.readthedocs.io/) by clicking **try lite now** badge above or use the [following link](https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.565420]https://andrej5elin.github.io/focused_beam/lab/) and open the notebook.
